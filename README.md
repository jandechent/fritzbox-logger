# fritzbox-logger
Intended for logging and plotting temperature from all actors connected to one fritzbox.

* FRITZ!DECT 200 (1x)
* Comet DECT Heizk√∂rperthermostat (4x)

# How to use
Execute fritzbox-logger/Logger.py to start logging. The thread generates one file per actor (LOG_*name*.txt)

Execute fritzbox-logger/Plotter.py to plot the temperature over time (LOG_*.txt).
